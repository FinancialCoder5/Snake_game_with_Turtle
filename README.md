## Introduction 
Why would I re-create this Legendary Game? 
Most of my childhood memories are attached to this game, always remember taking phone from my dad to play this game. 
But I haven't coded only for the sentimental value of the game its there because Games are very good to make your object oriented programming stronger.

## Task / Objective
Build the Legendary Snake game from the 90's which could, do pretty much operate the same.
Basic Rules of the Game:
- As soon the snake eats the food the snake increases in size and score is updated by 1.
- If the snake hits the wall or the snake's head comes in contact with its body the Game would be over.
